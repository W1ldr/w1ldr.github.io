Here is my process of switching to astro and configuring the theme for the initial setup

## Table of contents

## Why?
I needed something more simple and less painful to make custom changes. 

### Why Astro ?
the reason is me and simplicity, well there are other reasons like Javascript and the possibility to use html only if needed.
The fact that I can use any JS frontend framework make it more amazing. the framework is doing great and have a good community.
Thanks to the use os JS/typescript is making the learning curve simple
I almost forget to say, i Love to try new stuffs so for me astro is the way to goðŸ˜‚
  

## Setup
I'll update this post later with my current setup
